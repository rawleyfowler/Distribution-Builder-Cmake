Distribution::Builder::Cmake
====
A dead simple way to build a CMake project for FFI with Raku.

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/Distribution-Builder-Cmake/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/Distribution-Builder-Cmake/actions)

Synopsis
========

Installation
=========
```shell
zef install Distribution::Builder::Cmake
```

Usage
=========
Assuming your Raku project keeps its CMake project in a folder called `my-cmake-project`, and your exported lib is `my-lib`. 
Note, the final `.so` file will be `libmy-lib.so`.
In your `META6.json` you'll add the following:
```
{ 
    ...
    "builder": "Distribution::Builder::Cmake",
    "build": {
        "lib": "my-lib",
        "src-dir": "my-cmake-project"
    }
    ...
}
```

**Note**: You may also provide a `isntall` field to specify the directory to install the library. This defaults to: `resources/libraries/lib<your-lib>.so`

The typical CMake project will look like (assuming your lib is `my-lib`):
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)
project(my-lib VERSION 1.0.0 DESCRIPTION "My lib!")
add_library(my-lib SHARED my-lib.cc)
set_target_properties(my-lib PROPERTIES VERSION ${PROJECT_VERSION})
set_target_properties(my-lib PROPERTIES SOVERSION 1)
set_target_properties(my-lib PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER my-lib.hh)
target_include_directories(my-lib PRIVATE .)
install(TARGETS my-lib
	LIBRARY DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}
	PUBLIC_HEADER DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR})
```

You can see an example of this in action in [this repo](https://github.com/rawleyfowler/Raku-Cpp-Example)

(Obviously, you'll need Make and CMake installed)
